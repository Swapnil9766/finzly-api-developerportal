# **Technical guides**

**Getting started with Finzly APIs**

Finzly Support creates your credentials, users in your team, and API Keys.

Using the API keys, you can access the Finzly API.

Now you can invoke the APIs to test the use cases. To commence your evaluation, you will require an evaluation and integration environment set up for you.

## **Sandbox and testing**
The sandbox environment is an environment you can play around with and use as a testbed for development. Customers must test their business flows in this environment before moving to the production environment. You must use test customers and test account numbers in the sandbox environment. Your business bank will onboard you into the sandbox environment and provide you with the API credentials.

After testing and validating the use cases to your satisfaction, you can sign off on evaluation.

Please contact the Finzly support team to validate the integration.
