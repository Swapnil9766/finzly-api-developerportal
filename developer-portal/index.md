## **Introduction to Finzly Connect API**
Finzly Connect is a universal API designed to serve as the conduit between platforms/developers and banks that have Finzly’s modern payment infrastructure. Using this universal API, banks, fintechs, platforms and enterprises can access all the payment rails without stressing over the network and messaging rules. Additionally, other banking services like managing accounts, FX and administrative features can also be used. 

Finzly Connect runs on a real-time platform, FinzlyOS, that is connected to several US banks and offers a comprehensive repository of banking microservices that can be used to build platforms using APIs. Our products are delivered through a single API integration that can help you connect to a bank of your choice that is on the Finzly network.

Finzly Connect offers REST API and webhook notifications to access any Finzly-powered bank. Finzly has standardized the payment data and made the payment processing super simple, so a bank customer, whether a fintech, business or an individual, doesn't have to focus about the payment messaging rules, but just about their product innovation. Developers can access ACH, Domestic Wires, International Wires, RTP, and FedNow using Finzly Connect and process the payments through their favorite Finzly Bank.
