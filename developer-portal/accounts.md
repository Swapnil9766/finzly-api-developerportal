## **Accounts**

### **Direct Deposit Accounts**

Finzly Connect APIs allow platform providers to create direct deposit accounts with banks to help them carry out payment transactions on behalf of their customers.

Many platform providers prefer to set up their accounts as FBO accounts or For Benefit Of accounts. These accounts are held in the name of a beneficiary and can manage children entities which are in turn set up as virtual accounts. Money movement can be simplified for fintechs and platform providers who hold a master account (the FBO) with the bank. 

### **Customer setup using Virtual Accounts:**

Finzly Connect supports the creation and setting up of customer relationships using virtual accounts. Virtual accounts serve as subledgers allowing downstream setup associations to an existing deposit account. Platform providers can use these accounts to set up their customers or downstream partners, in turn, moving money in and out of these virtual accounts without latency and manual reconciliation. The Finzly Connect API allows virtual accounts to be assigned to consumers, suppliers, locations, or any other entity that needs tracking at an atomic level. 

Virtual accounts replace the need to create many individual bank accounts, while providing platform providers the ability to reconcile money movement at a granular level. Businesses and platform providers can bypass the need to manually manage client money, giving the flexibility to aggregate and segregate client money with up-to-date visibility of funds.

The flexible virtual account setup through Ledger-as-a-service can be used for client money management for Asset management, Pension Funds, Real estate, Digital wallets, Virtual cash management (POBO, COBO) and many more use cases.
