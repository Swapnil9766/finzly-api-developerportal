Account Validation is a vital facet of an organization’s risk assessment. Understanding their customers’ banking status will allow our clients to eliminate fraud and counter risks related to payment acceptance.

With credit cards, companies can approve or reject a transaction depending on the credit limit during payment time and set aside funds to cover the payments.


### **Gaming Platforms** 

Power payments for gaming platforms by allowing payments through API

### **E-com Payments** 

Power instant checkouts through bank transfers by offering payment API for real-time payments and refunds. 

The payment API is powered by the routing engine (rule-based workflow) to make it easy to understand. The consumer does not have to choose or decide on the payment rail or network (such as ACH, RTP FedNow, etc.) to create a payment. Instead, they have to choose from the simple options based on the payment speed and cost, for instance, "Economy" for less cost and 2 to 3 business days to transfer the money or "Instant" for a little higher price and instant money transfer.

The service allows users to review all incoming debits before they're cleared to settle against their account or rejected and returned. The bank can use the Positive Pay feature to determine the "decision cutoff" time and a default decision to pay or reject any debits.

## **Streamlining Customer Onboarding Processes for Banks**
Finzly APIs help the bank clients to accelerate their customer onboarding process.That allows our bank clients to win new customers,  vastly enhance the experience of customers applying for their products and service, and sell further services promptly. 

Customer onboarding is the next step after your customers have registered for the bank. Its objective is to allow your customers to feel comfortable utilizing your services and create a strong bond of trustworthiness. Usually, the customer onboarding procedure may include the following:

- Step-by-step instructions for account usage.
- Prefaces to your support team for further assistance.
- Landmark celebrations for customer engagement and satisfaction.

### **Benefits of accelerated onboarding**
- Having clear policies and procedures highlights to customers that an institution is not only aware of and actively trying to win their customers but also that they are compliant with regulations and within the confines of the law.

Illustrating to customers how a bank is actively working with regulations secures its reputation as a trustworthy institution that will keep money and other assets safe.

- Quick and efficient onboarding allows financial institutions less lead-in time to begin selling their services.

- Once a bank has boarded a customer, they will look to sell them several different products across different service areas. Comprehensively onboarding a customer rigorously allows other service areas to offer their products as soon as the customer has been onboarded. That also impacts the reputation of the institution in the customer’s eyes.
