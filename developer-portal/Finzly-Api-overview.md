# Finzly APIs

Finzly provides a modular platform that enables businesses, developers, and fintech to consume our APIs directly through banks or embed them into their products.
Users can launch financial products and services via API integration into our FinzlyOS platform.
Our API consists of modern RESTful messages to connect and communicate with our FinzlyOS platform. For every message, the platform returns a REST response.
Webhooks are sent in response to third-party actions
