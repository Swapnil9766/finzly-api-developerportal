## **Prefund vs Non-Prefund** 

To support the ACH Prefunding requirements for ACH Credits, Payment Galaxy provides a Prefunding capability, which causes the originator's offset account to be debited on the day their ACH file is processed, instead of waiting until the effective date of the ACH credits. Prior to routing the ACH credits to the FedACH network, the system will verify sufficient funds are available in the originator's account to fund the ACH credits. Alternatively, prefunding can be disabled, allowing for settlement to the originator's account on the effective date. For non-prefunded originators, you can assign exposure limits to monitor the overall amount of exposure to the bank.
