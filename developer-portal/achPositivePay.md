## **ACH Positive Pay** 

Positive Pay services allow the bank, and the bank's clients (via APIs or Finzly Treasury Experience) to enable rules to determine if ACH debits should be paid against the receiver's bank account. The service allows users to review all incoming debits before they’re cleared to pay against their account or rejected and returned. The bank can define a “decision cutoff” time, along with a default decision to pay or reject any debits that have not been decisioned.

## **Block List** 

The Block List is a service which provides the user the ability to identify specific ACH debit entries to be "stopped" and either returned automatically or to be manually decisioned as to whether the item should be returned or posted.
