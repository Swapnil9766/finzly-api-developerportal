## **International Payments**

International payments are made over the SWIFT network. Businesses and consumers can send and receive payments from global vendors and customers. As the sending and receiving parties are in different countries, payments are made using the SWIFT network.

Finzly Connect API simplifies sending and receiving global payments, allowing customers to track the payment status through timely notifications. Our APIs can connect your platform to banks that are connected to SWIFT, either through a correspondent bank or directly to the SWIFT network.

<!-- The commerce is now global, and the businesses have to routinely send and receive payments to and from global vendors and customers. Finzly Connect allows making global payments, tracking and payment notifications via API easier.

The domestic payment networks such as ACH, FEDWIRE, RTP and FEDNOW makes interborder settlement easier, but the international payments have more stringent compliance requirements and is more complex than domestic payments.

To process international payments, your bank should either be connected with a correspondent bank who have SWIFT connection, or your bank should have direct SWIFT connectivity. Finzly directly connects with SWIFT to settle and clear international payments for your bank.

Finzly Connect, with a single API, powers you to send international payments to any recipient in the globe and receive payment notifications from your bank account for easy and automatic reconciliation. -->
